# 🧹 Remove Commit History – GitHub Skills Course

> *Erase your mistakes, clean your Git history like a pro.*

Welcome to the **Remove Commit History** course, powered by GitHub Skills. In this course, you'll master the powerful `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to surgically remove sensitive data or unwanted files from a Git repository's commit history — like it never existed.

---

## 🚀 Why Take This Course?

Git is designed to keep a trustworthy, transparent history. But sometimes, secrets slip in — credentials, tokens, large files, or personal data. Undoing that can be messy... unless you know the right tools.

This course shows you **how to rewrite Git history safely** to remove sensitive files, and how to **avoid accidental commits** in the future.
